# Abdul Latif Munjiat Personal Website

Hey! Iam Abdul Latif Munjiat. How nice of you to look at my personal site, Thank you!

## Local Development

This is just a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Please use atleast Node v12, but the recommended version is Node v14 LTS. There's a `.nvmrc`, you can run `nvm use` if you have nvm installed.

## Getting Started

This project heavily favors <b>yarn</b> over npm.

So to set things up you need to run

```bash
yarn install
```

or just

```bash
yarn
```

Then to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

and it should open at

> http://localhost:3000/
